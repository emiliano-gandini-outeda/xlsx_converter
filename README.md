# üìä Sales & Inventory Scripts

A collection of simple scripts to automate data extraction and processing from Excel and CSV files I made when starting with pandas. Used for tracking sales, debts, projected balances, and inventory.

### ‚ú® Features

- Supports `.xlsx`, `.xls`, and `.csv`
- Sales analysis by client (`app1.py`)
- Projected balances per client (`app2.py`)
- Debt tracking by sale (`app4.py`)
- Inventory + supplier breakdown (`app5.py`)
- Basic web interface (Flask + Bootstrap)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These scripts are tailored for specific file formats from a client. Not meant to be general-purpose.
